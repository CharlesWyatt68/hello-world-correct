Hi there! 
The word Minotaur derives from the Ancient Greek Μῑνώταυρος, a compound of the name Μίνως (Minos) and the noun ταῦρος "bull", translated as "(the) Bull of Minos". In Crete, the Minotaur was known by the name Asterion,[7] a name shared with Minos' foster-father.[8] In Etruscan, the Minotaur had the name Θevrumineś.[9]
